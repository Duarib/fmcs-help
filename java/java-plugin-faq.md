## What plugins are not allowed?

Freemcserver.net support staff get asked this a lot of times. The answer that is given is anything that goes against tos. But people don't seems to understand it so, here I am going to explain the tos and those plugins that are not allowed. The tos can be found [here](https://freemcserver.net/site/tos).

Let's start off with the most common files:

* II.2 File Uploads and Server Content - any cracked plugin or mod - cracked plugins are plugins that are downloaded for free when the official plugin is set at a price. If the plugin is not cracked and has been properly bought and you have been suspended for it then click [here](java-plugin-faq.md#my-server-got-suspended-for-a-plugin-i-bought) for instructions.
* VI.12 Conduct, General Prohibitions - Run any kind of bot \(including, but not limited to, Discord or Teamspeak Bots\) - Bots are not allowed due to security reasons. So any kind of plugin like DiscordSRV or DiscordChat is not allowed.

## My server got suspended for a plugin I bought?

The server does not know if a user buys a plugin, so to be able to use the plugin that you have bought, you have to be whitelisted for that plugin. There is instruction below on how to verify the plugin is bought.

### How to join the plugin whitelist:

Send a message to the plugin developer to send a message to [Facha](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/esquilo_azul.19239/) \(Owner\). The message sent from the plugin developer must include:

* Your freemcserver.net username EXAMPLE: Minecraftpro1234
* Where you are going to use it EXAMPLE: freemcserver.net
* The plugin name/link EXAMPLE: featherboard
* The plugin hash for the version that is used \(The plugin developer should know this\)

As soon as [Facha](https://www.spigotmc.org/members/esquilo_azul.19239/) \(Owner\) gets the message via spigot which his username can be found by clicking his name. The person then gets the email saying he is whitelisted and is then allowed use the plugin. Further servers on the account, do not need to repeat the process. It is once per user per plugin.

## Banned Java Plugins:

The following plugins will get your server suspended. This list does not include cracked plugins as they are against the Terms of Service already. The Terms of Service can be found [here](https://freemcserver.net/site/tos).

* DiscordSRV - A plugin that enables users to see the chat, talk with them and see users that have logged in/out of their server from discord. Also allows to view the console from discord and have remote console capabilities too. This plugin goes against II.7 and VI.12 of the Terms of Service.
* Auto Restart - A plugin that enables the server to restart on its own. These plugins are against section II of the Terms of Service.
